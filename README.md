<h2 align="center">Mayonnaise Of The Day (Next.js Edition)</h2>

### Backstory
Mayonnaise took over Japan's nation back in the late 90's. Even a term <i>"Mayoler"</i> was born to describe a growing obsession with this condiment by Japanese, particularly among the younger generation.<br>
Fastfoward to 2022 – <i>"Mayoler"</i> is now a commonly used expression, and from my observation, the popularity does not remain within Japan.

To showcase the potential of mayonnaise, MOTD - Mayonnaise Of The Day - was created by the Mayo-Lover, for the Mayo-Lover, of the Mayo-Lover.
